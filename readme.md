## How to handle different type of user role in laravel without any packages?

What is middleware?
Laravel Middleware are the easy approach of verifying HTTP requests before they are passed to the controller.
It is provide filter your requests from client to server.

There are lots of package available for restrict role based user permission. But if you donâ€™t want to use package and complexity then create custom middleware and we can handle many role easily.

-We can create custom middleware by php artisan command:
	
	**php artisan make:middleware CheckRole**

Above command will create new file checkRole inside your app/Http/Middleware folder.

we must register middleware in app/Http/Kernel.php class otherwise it will give error our middleware class not found.


Ex:
	protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'checkRole' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckRole::class,
 	];


-**Handle multiple user role below code:**


public function handle($request, Closure $next,$role='')
{

        $userRole=$request->user();

        if($userRole && $userRole->count()>0)
        {
            $userRole=$userRole->role;
            $checkRole=0;
            if($userRole==$role && $role=='admin')
            {
                $checkRole=1;
            }
            elseif($userRole==$role && $role=='manager')
            {
                $checkRole=1;
            }
            elseif($userRole==$role && $role=='employee')
            {
                $checkRole=1;
            }
            
            if($checkRole==1)
                return $next($request);
            else
               return abort(401);
        }
        else
        {
            return redirect('login');
        }
    }

    -**generate table by below command:**
        php artisan migrate

    -**create user seeder by below command:**
        php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder

    -** insert users by below command:**
